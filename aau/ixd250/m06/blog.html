					<h3> LARGE VARIETY</h3>
					<h3> ALISA UTESHEVA	|	03.07.25</h3>

					<h3> I walked into Target and went straight to the candy aisle to take pictures for this project. I was amazed by the huge varietyâ€”Target really has so many options. Look at how many different versions of the same candy there are! This is Lindor chocolate, one of my favorites. I know many people who dislike this brand, but I don't mind. I love these chocolates.  </h3>

					<h3>It's the packaging that draws me in. I love the wrapping and the variety of flavors it offers. My favorite is the dark chocolate, since the milk chocolate in this brand tastes really bland. Usually in other brands I prefer milk chocolate. </h3> </div>

					<h3> HEALTHY ALTERNATIVES</h3>
					<h3> ALISA UTESHEVA	|	03.07.25</h3>

					<h3> I've always preferred the taste of natural flavors. When I eat overly processed foods, I enjoy them for a short while, but eventually, I start feeling ill and can't eat anything sweet for a while. However, these are different. They're freeze dried fruits, which is my favorite, and they're dipped in chocolate.  </h3>

					<h3>If you look at the packaging in the photo, these specific ones are fruit-shaped, which I think are better. There are cube shaped ones and they have a weird texture that I don't like.</h3> </div>
