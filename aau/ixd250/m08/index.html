				<h3>2. The First Computer Bug</h3>
				<div class="words">
					<h4> In 1947 engineers working on the 'Harvard Mark II' computer discovered a moth trap inside a relay, causing a malfunction. Making it the first lieral computer bug. The term 'bug' has already been used in engineering, but this term popularized it in computing. Grace Hopper created the word 'de-bugging' as a term for fixing the issue. Today both terms are crucial part of programming. </h4>

				<h3>3. Computer Virus</h3>
				<div class="words">
					<h4> The first ever computer virus was created in 1983 by a 15 year old boy named Ricard Skrenta. He wrote the virus as a experiment and named it "Elk Cloner". Fortunately it was not harmful. It was spread via floppy disk and displayed a poem on the infected computer. This help create anti- virus software at a early start of the computer life. </h4>

				<div class="words">
					<h4> First ever website was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. It was called the 'WorldWideWeb' The website was a simple text based page designed to explain the concept of WorldWideWeb. It is still accessible today allowing people to see how websites looked like back then.  On the left is what the WorldWideWeb looks like. The new website link is called "info.cern.ch", which will take you to a page with a bunch of links one of them is WorldWideWeb. </h4>

				<h3>5. Wooden Mouse</h3>
				<div class="words">
					<h4> The first ever computer mouse was invented by Douglas Engelbart in 1964 and the crazy part was that is was made out of wood. It was a project that was developed as a better way to interact with computers. The prototype has two wheels to track the movement on a flat surface, which was revolutionary at the time. The mouse we use right now is super different than the original one.</h4>
