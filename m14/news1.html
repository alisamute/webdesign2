    <h2>Fueling Our Team: New Cafeteria Now Open</h2>

    <p>Our updated cafeteria space is now open offering a clean, comfortable environment where team members can enjoy meals, take breaks, and recharge during the workday.</p>

    <p>We’re excited to welcome everyone into the refreshed space! Whether you’re swinging by for your morning coffee, catching up with coworkers over lunch, or just looking for a place to reset between meetings, the new cafeteria was designed to make your day better.</p>

    <h3>What’s New?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Modern, comfy seating for both solo moments and group hangouts</li>
      <li>Improved lighting and natural tones to create a calm, energizing vibe</li>
      <li>More food options and better kitchen appliances to keep up with your cravings</li>
      <li>Stronger Wi-Fi and more outlets for when you want to plug in while you power up</li>
      <li>Sustainable choices like energy-efficient lighting, reusable dishware, and recycling stations</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We’ve put a lot of thought into how people actually use the space—so there are now designated zones for different kinds of breaks. Want to catch up on emails? Grab a quiet corner. Need a midday brainstorm? Tables are ready. Just want to eat in peace? Totally doable.</p>

    <h3>Come Check It Out!</h3>
    <p>We’d love for everyone to explore the new space, try out the seating, and enjoy the refreshed menu options. It’s more than just a place to eat.</p>
    <p>It’s a place to pause, connect, and take a breath during the busy workday.</p>
    <p>Let us know what you think, we're always looking for ways to make the workplace even better.</p>
